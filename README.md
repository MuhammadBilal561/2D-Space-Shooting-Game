ðŸš€ Just Completed a Console-Based Shooting Game in C++!

I'm excited to share my latest project â€” a 2D Space Shooting Game built entirely in the C++ console. ðŸŽ®âœ¨

ðŸ§  What I Learned:

Game loops, input handling, and collision detection

Level progression logic and dynamic enemy spawning

Rendering ASCII graphics with color using the Windows API

Managing power-ups, bullets, and enemy AI in real-time

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack:

Language: C++

Platform: Windows Console

Libraries: <windows.h>, <conio.h>, <ctime>, <fstream>

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:

Smooth player and enemy movement

Bullet collision and enemy AI

Score tracking, level upgrades, and win/loss conditions

Custom map loading and color-coded gameplay

This was a great way to reinforce core programming concepts while exploring basic game development. Next, I'm planning to explore SDL or SFML for a GUI-based version! ðŸš€

ðŸ§© Check out the game logic breakdown, flowchart, and screenshots in the post!
